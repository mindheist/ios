0.0.2 - This version now has a clickable farmhouse. Once again, this is a dummy button right now. Also its directly a stage 7 farmhouse.I ll switch this out and correlate with levels.

0.0.1 - This version now has a clickable Barn and Silo.They don't do anything though.It also has 4 patches ( these are tea patches,they'll become empty in the next checkin)
