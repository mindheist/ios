This is just an index page for all the projects in this folder. This also has all the notes I m making as I learn ( watch tutorial videos et all). 


Project II - Following the instruction here , learning about sprite kit : https://www.raywenderlich.com/145318/spritekit-swift-3-tutorial-beginners


BullsEye Project : https://github.com/mindheist/ios/tree/master/BullsEye
Video 1-6:

Created a simple app so far , that has a button & clicking on it throws an Alert. Somethign that I hadn't realized all these days is that the iOS alert window has two parts to it. The alert and the action. Both of these are defined seperately and then the action is added to the Alert. 

The Alert and the action has styles. The alert can pop up as an action script as well, Action script style springs up from the bottom while the default launches something like a modal. One of the available action styles is "destructive", the color of the action text is red for this style . This is to indicate the action is going to be destructive.

There is also a "present" function which I haven't fully understood yet.

Video 7 : Remember , everything your app does is triggered by an event.

Video 8 : Point Vs Pixels Relationship. Remember we work with points and not pixels ( Graphic designers too).

Also learnt how to restrict the app to work on in landscape mode (by editing the project settings, note there was no code change required to do this.)


End of Section I

================================================================

Section 2 :

Connected the value of the slider to Alert Pop up.

Learn a few things about @IBoutlet - I still dont fully understand how this works , but this is good for now. And learnt how to connect IBOutlet variable to the slider.

Added the IBOutlets to a couple of more labels (ie) to the rounds and the score label. Added some more alerting code. Even if I put the slider on the target , it fails for some reason. There is some int / float stuff going on here.

End of Section 2

================================================================

Section 3: Added more logic around scores , bonus points et all . This was pretty prelimnary.

================================================================

Section 4 : One of things that I noticed earlier too (ie) the score and round updates even before we have dimissed the alert. Going over this in Section 4. We do this using closures , I dont fully understand why the syntax looks like this, but works for now.

Secondly , Also learned how to add another ViewController & how to link it to the previous controllers.

Section 5 : Styling with Images and Labels
