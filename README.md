This is just an index page for all the projects in this folder. This also has all the notes I m making as I learn ( watch tutorial videos et all).

Created a simple app so far , that has a button & clicking on it throws an Alert. Somethign that I hadn't realized all these days is that the iOS alert window has two parts to it. The alert and the action. Both of these are defined seperately and then the action is added to the Alert. 

The Alert and the action has styles. The alert can pop up as an action script as well, Action script style springs up from the bottom while the default launches something like a modal.

There is also a "present" function which I haven't fully understood yet.
